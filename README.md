# Greyscale-Image-Colorization-using-Deep-Learning
This full-stack project combines Deep Learning and OpenCV to colorize grayscale images. It includes a frontend web interface for uploading images and a backend powered by Flask (or Node.js) using a pretrained Caffe CNN model. OpenCV manages preprocessing, inference, and postprocessing, producing vibrant and realistic colorized outputs.
